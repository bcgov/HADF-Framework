#Human Resources

Archetype: Human Resources

What is it?
A major and extensive category of business processes and supporting tools that facilitate human resources functions such as management of employee personnel records, staff acquisition, discipline, benefits, and retirement, also time & attendance, resource planning and allocation, skills management, and team & organizational management. Most ministries have an internal HR function.  

Keywords: hiring, staffing, retention, job description, benefits, time and leave, recruitment, performance evaluation

What it is not: Learning management has been defined as a separate category and is not currently considered in the scope of HR for this exercise.  The Public Service Agency (PSA) is the central body responsible for human resources management. Not all PSA applications are necessarily HR applications.  Management of contractors is not considered HR. Also, contract management is its own category, not in scope here.

Examples: Oracle Human Capital Management (HCM), Oracle PeopleSoft, SAP, KRONOS

Preferred direction: Examine the feasibility of decomposing the mega-vendor suite and its feature-set to accommodate a more flexible, modular approach to the larger set of HR capabilities.  This would emphasize the critical nature of integrations. 

For Discussion:  Is status quo satisfactory?  Decentralization seems consistent with many other corporate capabilities.  Is that a conscious strategy, or an evolution?
