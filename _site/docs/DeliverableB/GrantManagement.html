      <p>#Grant Management</p>

<p>What is it?
A grant is issued by a ministry to fund a specific project or initiative. Grant recipients typically require an application to indicate interest and eligibility, and some level of compliance and reporting.  A grant management application is used to organize, possibly publish, prioritize, and process the grant applications received from citizens or businesses. Grants are typically a one-time allocation.</p>

<p>What it is not: This is not the same as capital investment proposals and allocation, though at a very fundamental base layer there are similarities.  Capital is typically an allocation of much largers sums. Grants are often one-time.  Ongoing and predictable funding should be categorized as financial management.</p>

<p>Keywords: award, scholarship, bursary, grant</p>

<p>Preferred Direction: Aggregate need across Government to survey the potential for a reduction in implementations, and a common toolset.  Determine where each implementation is in its lifecycle, place it on a lifecycle spectrum, and target a first replacement with participation from stakeholders with a template.</p>

<p>For discussion: Could we find, or build, an application that was sufficiently configurable to address needs?</p>
