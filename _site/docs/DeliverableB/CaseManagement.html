      <p>#Case Management
Archetype: Case Management</p>

<p>What is it?  Case management is the coordination of services on behalf of an individual within settings such as health care, nursing, rehabilitation, social work, disability insurance, employment, and law.  However, in the legal context, case management may refer to the collection and management of material (evidence, argument for both sides, judgements, appeals) specific to a particular matter between two individuals (one of which may be The Crown.) The need to secure personal information is generally higher in a case management context.</p>

<p>What it is not: In this context, cases are more focused in individuals than technology, so an IT Trouble Ticket system would not be considered “case management”.  It is not Customer Relationship Management (CRM), though case management systems may be based upon CRM.  There are considerably more marketing capabilities embodied in CRM, used to convince “leads” of a need for a product or service.  There is often considerably more “document management” and “records management” used within case management.</p>

<p>Examples of Case Management: Delivery and tracking of services to a specific individual, such as a child in care, a homeless individual, and patient receiving care for a specific illness.</p>

<p>Preferred Direction:  To aggregate need, recognize high-level use cases, and recomment approaches to address the need.  There may also be opportuniteis to decompose larger case management requirements, so that they may be addressed with smaller contracts or services or solutions.</p>

<p>For discussion: How does case management influence the case collective?  That is, upon “completion” of a case, it may become part of a larger collection available for the (public) consumption (open data).  What does a common service look like in this context?</p>
