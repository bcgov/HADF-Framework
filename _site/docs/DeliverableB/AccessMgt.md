#Access Management

Archetype: Access Management

What is it?  Access management includes the identy verification, and authorization of an individual's ability to access a system, application or any IT instance. It is a broad concept that encompasses all policies, processes, methodologies and tools to maintain access privileges within an IT environment.  It includes administration of accesses, as well as logging of  administration and access attempts to facilitate audit. Access management is a class of applications that stands alone, and should be distinguished from "role-based access" to privileged functions within an application.  The former is implemented with a class of tool, the latter is an implementation detail within an application that is influenced through standards and guidelines.

Keywords: authentication, authorization, roles, single sign-on (SSO)

What it is not: This is not role-based access, which is the responsibility of an application or system.  Role-based access may consume features and capabilities within a similar system that implements access management, but they are not the same thing.
 
Examples: Azure Active Directory (AD) may be used to control access to systems and networks.  Through the use of groups and membership, Azure AD may also be used to restrict access to specific functionality within an application.    

Preferred Direction: Focus on a single authoritative source for managing access to Government systems.  Delegate the ability to manage access to applications to the owners of those applications. Continue to improve real-time monitoring and alert capabilities.
