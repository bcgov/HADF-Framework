#Customer Relationship Management

Archetype: Customer Relationship Management

What is it?  
Customer relationship management (CRM) is the management of an organization's interaction with current and potential customers. Customers in a public sector context include citizens, businesses, and other stakeholders. Some defining features of a CRM include a centralized contact list and correspondence tracking. A CRM may include workflow capabilities, analytical features to measure customer satisfaction, lead potential, and integrations with call centre applications, and other communication systems such as email. 
 
What it is not: We must distinguish between the need for a CRM solution, and building other systems upon a platform that is (or was) at its core, a CRM system, simply because they are related systems.  Although "case management" might be (arguably) seen by some as a derivative of CRM, for this exercise, one is not the other.  A "CRM platform" is not necessarily CRM, though it does enable CRM capabilities. 

Examples: Out-of-the-box Microsoft Dynamics could be classified as a CRM system, as could SalesForce.  However, given the risk and associated cost, of building dependencies upon a platform such as (SalesForce) force.com or upon Dynamics (the PaaS), for this exercise, we must differentiate between them.  

Preferred Direction: Distinguish CRM from the platforms upon which they’re built.  Determine guidelines for the use of both, and provide advisory services for implementation of both.  Guard against the accidental overlap – build upon a CRM platform must be an explicit and fully-informed decision, to guard against vendor product and service lock-in, and to optimize exit costs. 

For discussion: Should "lower-level" capabilities like the ones mentioned above (mail, analytics, workflow) be in this list, or a separate list, or neither?
