#Call Centre
Archetype: Call Centre

What is it?  A call centre is a (logical, and may be one or more locations representing a) collection of phone lines, usually staffed, used for receiving and/or transmitting a high volume of enquiries by telephone.   A Call Centre can be supplemented with an Interactive Voice Response unit that may collect statistics and routes calls.  A Call Centre is often supported by a "tracking" system that helps steward a call or incident to some kind of resolution.
 
What it is not : Many ministries have a tracking function for ministerial correspondence. This does not necessarily constitute a call centre. 

Preferred Direction: To aggregate and document enterprise-wide need for a call centre capability, and provide a short list of recommended approaches.  Those approaches may include a short list of vendors providing services and/or tools in support.
