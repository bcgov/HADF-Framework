# Product plays​

## Engaging product owner​
Stakeholders: Who are the key stakeholders (leadership, including sign-off/advocacy and delivery)?  Distinguish between ‘inform’ stakeholders and ‘responsible’ stakeholders. Inform stakeholders should be notified and kept in the loop, while responsible stakeholders will potentially play a role in the design and build process.  An email to the inform stakeholders outlining your work should suffice, and a wiki page is even better (a web-based product called Confluence is a great tool for this). Responsible stakeholders should be engaged in-person — try to consolidate to as few meetings as you can allowing for direct communication.
The role of the product owner is to set the goals for the CRM, each release and each sprint. The product owner also describes all the requirements and acceptance criteria. He or she must be available to participate in every sprint event and have a senior role in the organisation such that they command a level of authority so that they alone can make prioritisation decisions. They have a responsibility to accept requirements when they are done, identify bugs and new stories.

## Selecting the platform​
A CRM is supposed to streamline business processes, particularly in the way of sales and marketing. With that in mind, you need to identify your business bottlenecks before you begin your hunt for a CRM. Start by “evaluating your existing business processes and their outcomes, then compare them to their desired outcomes and business objectives to determine the gap." Create a "wish list" of goals that you want in a CRM. Determine which items are high priority and which are "nice-to-haves," then refer to that list when comparing potential solutions to determine which features and which product will help you best accomplish your goals.
## Selecting the team​
Which teams do you anticipate providing input/support in the development and management of the CRM?
