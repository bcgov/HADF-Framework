## Engaging Product Owner​
![Engaging the Product Owner](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/67f2e8_55fc1863fbfb4ed89a0b1a85b93e199d~mv2.gif)
The role of the product owner is to set the goals for the CRM, each release and each sprint. The product owner also describes all the requirements and acceptance criteria. He or she must be available to participate in every sprint event and have a senior role in the organisation such that they command a level of authority so that they alone can make prioritisation decisions. They have a responsibility to accept requirements when they are done as well as helping to identify bugs and create new stories.
The best product owners are:

* **Outcomes-oriented**: is able to clearly describe the desired business outcomes impacted by the business application, able to set sprint goals that inspire the development team.
* **Well-respected**: is able to make prioritisation decisions without deferring to someone else, and holds significant influence over the intended application users.
* **Narrators**: is able to describe the business requirements and acceptance criteria in sufficient detail that the features can be developed, tested and accepted.
* **Entrusted**: has integrity and is trusted by other senior stakeholders to balance competing priorities.
* **Readily-available**: can attend all the sprint ceremonies, the daily standups, and is frequently available for questions regarding stories and features.
* **Delegators**: No man is an island. The best product owners distibute workloads so as not to overwhelm any single team member or themselves.
* **Conflict Resolvers**: As a product owner, you have to have the courage and the capability to engage when things get difficult. And know this: you generally have to go through conflict to get to a solution. You'll need to be collaborative to minimize the negative, and you'll need to mediate effectively.

With these attributes, engaging with a product owner can seem intimidating. Know this, product owners want results, and they typically want them quickly. Don't expect a favourable outcome if you're two weeks behind in your sprints and your back-log is longer than the sum of your user stories. Product owners will be reasonable ... to a point, but to keep them engaged and active in the project they can't be distracted by other competing elements.

## Selecting the Platform​
![Selecting the Platform](https://www.lassocrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/check-mark-characteristics-blog.jpg)
A CRM is supposed to streamline business processes, particularly in the way of sales and marketing. With that in mind, you need to identify your business bottlenecks before you begin your hunt for a CRM. Start by “evaluating your existing business processes and their outcomes, then compare them to their desired outcomes and business objectives to determine the gap." Create a "wish list" of goals that you want in a CRM. Determine which items are high priority and which are "nice-to-haves," then refer to that list when comparing potential solutions to determine which features and which product will help you best accomplish your goals. 
Rarely is there a one-size-fits-all solution; be expected to accept compromises when it comes to looking for a CRM platform that doesn't check all  of your boxes.
The ideal CRM platform is:
* **Manageable**: Customer relationship management software is about managing your relationships with your customers and clients. Users can manage each customer case individually and efficiently to improve customer satisfaction levels. You have a CRM because your customers are like your assets; maage them effectively and they will help you grow your business.
* **Integrateable**: Your CRM of choice should not require you to put in a lot of work upfront. A good CRM is a CRM which lets you quickly and easily import data from existing databases. Instead of wasting time copying info from various sources by hand, you should be able to get straight to business and put you CRM to good use right off the bat. Your CRM should also be able to link directly with your existing email contacts with little to no effort.
* **Useable**: Even the best CRM system is useless if your employees don't know how to use it. When deciding between CRM solutions make sure that the one you pick is easy to use, has an intuitive interface, ample documentation and good user support. The time spent training your employees to use your CRM should be as short as possible - after all, the whole point of having a CRM is increasing efficiency, rather than wasting time.
* **Future Proof**: If you're thinking about getting a CRM, you are also obviously planning to grow your business. This is why you should make sure that whichever CRM you choose is easily adaptable to your future needs. A good CRM doesn't just fit your company's current needs, but also has the potential to grow with you: it should include multiple modules, features and possibilites for integration.
* **Reportable**: A good CRM should let you analyze customer & employee activites and use the information for the benefit of your company. This is why the CRM you choose should have reporting and tracking features.
## Selecting the Team​

Which teams do you anticipate providing input/support in the development and management of the CRM? You want a team that not only checks all of the competencies boxes but also works well together and is synergistic in their work orchestration efforts. Team agility is the holy grail of team competencies, being able to shift directions at a moments notice without faltering. Pull together a group of  people to work on any project, and they will develop a culture of their own, and it will be as unique as the people in the group.
The ideal team is:

* **Results oriented**: If your team members aren't rowing in the same direction, you could be going in circles. Your team needs to see the target before they get there so they can work as one to fufill the requirements of the solution in real time.
* **Communicative**: This may be a given, but often we neglect the importance of communication when choosing our team members. A high performing team needs to be open about their thoughts and actions to be efficient on tasks and outcomes. Poor communication leads to crossed-wires and missed opportunities.
* **Supportive**: No man (person) is left behind. Good team members support one another and provide assistance when necessary to ensure that moral is maintained at a high level and the project stays on course. A team that sticks together, works together.
* **Fun**: Building a positive relationship with your colleagues can make for a much more relaxed environment and reduce conflict. Personality selection during recruitment is not a trivial exercise which means effort needs to be put into discovering each prospective team members emotional intellect. It is often better to select someone who is OK at coding but is outgoing and likeable than one who is a great at coding but prefers to be a loner.
