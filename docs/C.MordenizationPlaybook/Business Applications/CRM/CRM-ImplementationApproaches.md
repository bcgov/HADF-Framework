# Implementation Approaches

## On Prem
 
One of the options for implementing a CRM solution is building a custom one.
 
### Pros
 
  1. Ability to customize and build features that are essential to your organization
  2. Complete control on your systems and data
 
### Cons
 
  1. You need to set up an agile team to iteratively develop and manage the custom build solution
  2. The time and cost taken to custom build a CRM solution are on the higher side
  3. You might end up reinventing the wheel
 

### Cloud
 
  According to a study by IBM, 88% of CRM solutions were on premise and custom build in 2008 whereas 87% are cloud based today. By choosing to move towards a Cloud CRM or SaaS solution, you are relieved off installing, configuring and maintaining your own servers and infrastructure for the CRM solution. You only pay for the licenses per the number of users.
 
### Pros
 
1. Lower upfront cost
 2. The installation, maintenance, upgrades, back-ups, integration and resolution of technical issues are all managed by the vendor.
3. Quicker deployment process.
4. Flexibility of payment â€“ you can increase or decrease subscriptions as and when required.
 
### Cons
 
1. Possible vendor lock-in
