# Customer Relationship Management

**Archetype: Customer Relationship Management**

## Patterns  

Customer relationship management (CRM) is the management of an organization's interaction with current and potential customers. Customers in a public sector context include citizens, businesses, and other stakeholders. Some defining features of a CRM include a centralized contact list and correspondence tracking. A CRM may include workflow capabilities, analytical features to measure customer satisfaction, lead potential, and integrations with call centre applications, and other communication systems such as email. 
 
## Anti-Patterns:

We must distinguish between the need for a CRM solution, and building other systems upon a platform that is (or was) at its core, a CRM system, simply because they are related systems.  Although "case management" might be (arguably) seen by some as a derivative of CRM, for this exercise, one is not the other.  A "CRM platform" is not necessarily CRM, though it does enable CRM capabilities.
