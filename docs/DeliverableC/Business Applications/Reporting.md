# Reporting

What is it? A reporting system is used to organize data into informational summaries to measure performance according to pre-defined criteria. 

Keywords: metrics, extract, Jasper, reporting, etc. 

What is it not: Reporting is not the same as analytics. Reporting raises questions, analytics attempts to answer them.
