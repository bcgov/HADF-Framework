# Engaging the Product Owner

The role of the product owner is to set the goals for each sprint and each release. The product owner also describes all the requirements and acceptance criteria. He or she must be available to participate in every sprint event and have a senior role in the organisation such that they command a level of authority so that they alone can make prioritisation decisions. They have a responsibility to accept requirements when they are done as well as helping to identify bugs and create new stories.
The best product owners are:

* **Outcomes-oriented**: able to clearly describe the desired business outcomes impacted by the business application, able to set sprint goals that inspire the development team.
* **Well-respected**: able to make prioritisation decisions without deferring to someone else, and holds significant influence over the intended application users.
* **Narrators**: able to describe the business requirements and acceptance criteria in sufficient detail that the features can be developed, tested and accepted.
* **Entrusted**: has integrity and is trusted by other senior stakeholders to balance competing priorities.
* **Readily-available**: can attend all the sprint ceremonies, the daily standups, and is frequently available for questions regarding stories and features.
* **Delegators**: able to distibute workloads so as not to overwhelm any single team member or themselves.
* **Conflict Resolvers**: able to resolve conflicts, act as a mediator between the stakeholders and the team and maximize engagement and collaboration

Product Owners are result-oriented and work with the team towards building a Minimum Viable Product(MVP) every sprint cycle (generally spanning across 2 weeks) which delivers value to the business and other stakeholders. Product owners maintain a backlog of features/bugs/changes with regular interaction with the stakeholders. They prioritize these features/updates required for an MVP for a given sprint and create a sprint backlog which is a subset of the product backlog. The Product Owner works along with the Scrum Master to ensure the team maintains a steady velocity each sprint, where velocity is defined as the average of the number of stories completed by the team in the previous sprints.

It is important that the Product Owners remain active and engaged with the project. Read the article: 21 Methods to Engage and Retain Your Product Owner in an Agile Project for an informative view on engaging the PO.
