# Registries

**Archetype: Registries**

The province owns several registries which are considered authoritative, and that robustly implement most of the characteristics of a registry defined above.  

## Patterns  

British Columbia's Orgbook is our Business Registry.  Using blockchain as the underlying technology, it implements most, if not all, characteristics of a Registry outlined in the Common Understanding pages.

More to come.


## Anti-Patterns:

Wikipedia defines "anti-pattern" as "a common response to a recurring problem that is usually ineffective and risks being highly counterproductive."  In the context of registries, several factors can influence an anti-pattern.  An unknown or undefined owner of a registry can cause inconsistent - potentially harmful - approaches to collecting, storing, managing, and retrieving data.  

In accommodating storage of People information, we may find it easier or cheaper to build a new database for People storage than to designate an enterprise owner of People, and join forces with a single, "higher order" Registry. The following are examples of counterproductive (from an enterprise perspective) approaches to the problem at hand.

- an HR application that maintains its own copy of employee name, and that information is provided from somehwere other than an acknowledged master People Registry.
- Species databases that are based upon region.  This example shows that what might be a justified approach to a business problem can cause duplication and uncertainty - because a species likely does not restrict itself to a geogaphic region.  We end up with duplication of a species across regional databases, and risk conficting data.
- An application that allows users to type in the city in which they live.
