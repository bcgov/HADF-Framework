# Service Expectations

While Service Level Agreements (SLAs) may exist today between the Government of British Columbia and service providers who ensure underlying computing infrastructure meets expectations, generally no formal SLAs or support agreements have been established for solution platforms, or software procured through the OCIO.  

There is an opportunity to determine roles, responsibilities, and expectations of both the OCIO and consuming ministry business organizations associated with the procurement, licensing, implementation, customization, deployment, maintenance, and support of largely off-the-shelf software and software-as-a-service. 

With respect to CRM, and the current four pre-qualified suppliers, this section seeks to pose (if not currently answer) questions like:

- Who deals with vendors?
- Who negotiates agreements?  Will there be more than one, or more than one type, of agreement?
- How do I get licenses to use product x?  How quickly can I get them?
- What kind of approvals are required prior to procuring my licenses?
- Who performs those approvals, and what prequalification process must I accomplish?
- Is there someone who can help me determine an approach to my CRM problem?
- How do I know that my business opportunity can be addressed with CRM?
- I am having challenges with integrations to other systems - who do I call?

With these kinds of questions in mind, the following proposes an initial set of tasks grouped by ministries and the OCIO.  These responsibilities, their definitions, and the roles that fill them are to be refined over time.

## Ministry responsibilities​

- Ensure that a CRM solution is appropriate for the problem.
- Consider integration requirements & its approach.
- Consider compatibility with existing technology footprint.
- Develop a roadmap for the capability being addressed, and the technology implementing it.
- Engage your Enterprise Architect. Or reach out to the OCIO / EAU
- Assess implementation options - Beside status quo, are there more than two options?
- Be familiar with the vendor's licensing model, and the expected cost of deployment scenarios.
- Illustrate the solution and interfacing systems to show high-level functionality.
- Research similar business capabilities within the BC Government for opportunities to collaborate and leverage work already done.
- Break the problem into small pieces that can be delivered in a short time. 
- Engage the OCIO Enterprise Architecture Unit.
- Engage with the Digital Investment Office.
- Secure funding through the OCIO Digital Investment Office and/or Treasury Board.
- Advise the OCIO / EAU of smaller CRM capital investments that don't require DIO review

## OCIO responsibilities​

- Negotiate Government vendor licensing agreements.
- Facilitate license acquisition.
- Understand the business of Government across the enterprise. 
- Raise awareness of common problems, approaches, and solutions - these opportunities are likely not to be exclusively technical. Business process, technology, information, data, and people-sharing opportunities likely abound.
- Ensure that existing good work across Government is considered, if not leveraged, widely.
- Facilitate collaboration on technology spikes. 
- Facilitate collaborative work on common services.
- Promote standard treatment of enterprise business entities (like businesses, land, people, and so on).
- Source support expertise to address technology challenges, unknowns and experiments.
- Ensure availability of varied and appropriate infrastructure services that address a spectrum of ministry needs 
- Advise on vendor and technology selection, and on solution approaches

## Communities of Practice​

Collaboration on :
    - approaches to business problems
    - shared implementations of common business capabilities
    - common component definitions
    - development, documentation of technology best practices through direct experience with technology solutions

There is, at time of writing, a Dynamics community of practice, chaired out of CITZ Information Management Branch. In the Education sector, there are on-premise and cloud instances of Dynamics and emerging subject matter expertise.
