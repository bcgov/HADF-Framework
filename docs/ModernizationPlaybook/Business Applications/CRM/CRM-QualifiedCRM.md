# CRM Platforms

## Pre-qualified CRM Options

The Province of BC currently has four pre-qualified CRM platforms. 

1. **Salesforce**<sup> *1* </sup>: Salesforce is an online cloud-based customer relationship management system which integrates your customers and breaks the silos between marketing, sales, commerce and IT services.

2. **Microsoft Dynamics 365**<sup> *2* </sup>: Dynamics 365 is a product line of enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management that helps you run your entire business and deliver greater results through predictive, AI-driven insights.

3. **ServiceNow**<sup> *3* </sup>: ServiceNow helps connect customer service with other teams within an organization to resolve issues quickly and proactively.

4. **Oracle Fusion**<sup> *4* </sup>: Oracle Fusion is a cloud-based PaaS solution which enables enterprises to create and run agile, intelligent business applications while maximizing IT efficiency through full utilization of modern hardware and software architectures.

When a CRM solution has to be implemented, it is important to explore the various options available in the market before you decide to build a custom solution. 


## Preferred Direction

The preferred direction to distinguish between various CRM options is :

- Distinguish CRM from the platforms upon which they’re built
- Determine guidelines for the use of both, and provide advisory services for implementation of both.  
- Guard against the accidental overlap – building upon a CRM platform must be an explicit and fully-informed decision, to guard against vendor product and service lock-in, and to optimize exit costs.

## CRM Procurement in BC Gov

In 2018 the Province of BC submitted a Request for Qualification (RFQ 060518 CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT (“CRM”) PLATFORM) to build a pre-qualified list of cloud CRM platform vendors able to seamlessly manage the diverse set of interactions both internal and external to government.

Applicants were screened by the Province on technical, security, and privacy requirements outlined in the RFQ Questionnaire. The RFQ does not include implementation or other related professional services or subscription resellers.

The RFQ is open for 5 years and currently has four successful applicants:
