# Other CRM Platforms

## Open Source CRM
 
 Proprietary CRM solutions are finalized products which mostly require a subscription. If you would rather customize and modify the CRM solution to suit your needs, it is best to choose a free and open source CRM solution.

 Several open source solutions are available in the market. Though there are a few open source CRM solutions that are available as SaaS, most of these solutions are available to be consumed in the form of source code and would require a team of developers to implement the solution using on-prem or cloud infrastructure and maintain the same.

 Some of the open source CRM solutions are given below:

### HubSpot CRM

## Serverless Options
<br />

 Deploying a CRM solution using Cloud as opposed to hosting on premise has the following benefits:

  1. There is no underlying hardware or infrastructure or maintain
  2. Ensures high availability and resilience
  3. There is tighter integrations with other cloud products
  4. It is easier and faster to implement a CRM solution on cloud
  5. The CRM applications would be highly scalable on cloud

  In order to further reduce costs, you can make use of Functions as a Service (FaaS) to execute tasks which happen less frequently in order to save cloud resources. 
  
  For example, Approvals and Consents on Applications might not happen very frequently. It would be best to trigger these operations as serverless functions when these events are triggered.
