# Total Cost Considerations

Total Cost Considerations: 

The cost of deploying a CRM may start with base product licences, infrastructure (instances, environments, security, identity), various levels of support offered by the vendor and additional capabilities required (attached licences, analytics and reporting, external or custom app integration). There may be additional one time, recurring and/or development costs involved to fulfill the business or technical requirements for the successful completion of the project. 

Depending on the product subscribed, be aware of the limits marked by the vendors (data storage and transfer, number of API calls, number of logins/page views).
Factors to consider that may impact total cost of ownership:

1.	Number of instances 
2.	Number of environments (sandbox, prod, test, dev environments)
3.	Number of licences (base)
4.	Number of licences (attached) – attached licences enable additional CRM capabilities. For example, business area has a base licence for case management CRM, additionally attached licence adds capabilities for marketing CRM
5.	Data/instance (volume cost - how much data is collected and stored)
6.	External application integration (e.g. Office productivity integration)
7.	Number of logins
8.	Number of add on custom apps
9.	Number of API calls
10.	Internal network vs external network (Direct connect or VPN tunnels to government network)
11.	Number of page views
12.	External user authenticated or unauthenticated
13.	On-premise vs software as a service
14.	Advanced analytics/reporting + notifications

These cost (per unit) and limits are usually identified in the contract. Vendors can provide one-time, ongoing or volume discount depending on the negotiated deal. Vendors usually have different pricing models for products they offer. For example, licences for MS Dynamics can be based on individual access over multiple devices or device access for multiple users. 

The following table lists rack rates for base licence for case management and additional capabilities that may be required as part of the CRM deployment. The rates are quoted in US dollars.
