 Data is the most important and vulnerable aspect of any enterprise. Data can be largely classified into three types:

 1. **Structured Data** : Structured Data adheres to a defined model and can be readily analysed. They are typically found in tabular format arranged as rows and columns. 

 2. **Unstructured Data** : Unstructured Data is that which doesnt adhere to any particular form making it difficult to be analysed using traditional methods.

 3. **Semistructured Data** : Semi-structured Data is does not conform with the formal structure of rows and columns, but contains tags or other elements to distinguish records and fields within the data making it easier to be analysed than unstructured data.
