# C. Modernization Playbook 

## Introduction – Digital Enterprise Architecture 

Architecture can be described as the decisions that are required to be made up front that have a significant impact on the long-term success of any given undertaking. 

In the technology and business landscape there are typically 5 layers of architecture.

**Enterprise:** Enterprise Architecture is concerned with the holistic organization or system, as in all associated things, and is typically aimed at achieving alignment… aka ensuring local optimization in one part of the system is not contributing to less than ideal outcomes overall. 
 
**Business:** Business Architecture is concerned with the people, processes and technology required to usefully run a program or line of business.

**Solution:** Solution Architecture is concerned with a business solution and the optimal selection and integration of components to most effectively and efficiently meet the business need. These components are made up of software, compute and storage. 

**Application & Data:** Application Architecture is concerned with the best way to engineer software to ensure it’s highly useable, resilient and will have longevity. Data architecture has the same aims but specifically with respect to structured data.

**Technical:** While both solution and application and data architecture, could be considered technical in nature, by Technical Architecture we mean being dedicated to discussion and comparison of technical protocols and standards such as those that enable technologies such as the internet, voice over IP and other foundational pieces of technology to operate.  

In this context Solution Architecture is the intermediary between the business and applications so it makes sense as the starting place for us in the context of the Hosting and Application Development Framework, as we attempt to reduce existing technical barriers to amazing services for citizens and businesses (and public servants too) in BC. 

## Solution Architecture 
Solutions are typically created through the orchestration of 3 main building blocks or components: software (applications), compute and storage (hosting). In 2020 each of these categories breaks into a myriad of categories, representing numerous multitudes of options and approaches, with overlapping definitions, pros and cons - and there’s new variants emerging everyday!

Having a basic hierarchy and taxonomy of these components help us keep track of new and emerging opportunities for creating solutions to support awesome modern service experiences and exceptional outcomes.
